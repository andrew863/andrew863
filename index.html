  <h3 style="color:brown"> About our founder! </h3>
  
<p>Rodney Loves Pizza. Heâ€™s always loved pizza, but he especially loved going out to dinner with his family at their local pizza place when he was a kid. He grew up dreaming of starting a pizzeria of his own, but never had the money to go into business. He started a small tech company ten years ago that he recently sold to Facebook for a modest sum and decided now was the time to pursue his childhood dreams. Where Rodney can reach families that will appreciate reasonable priced meals and a freshly made Pizza!
